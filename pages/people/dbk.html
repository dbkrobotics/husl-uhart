        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Dongbin Kim is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
            at the University of Hartford (UHart). Prior to this, he was a U.S. Army Research
            Lab Research Fellow at the United States Military Academy at West Point (USMA).
            His work was to enhance the air-ground robot swarm team for the U.S. Department
            of Defense (US-DOD) ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) missions.
            Before joining the USMA, he was an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Howard R. Hughes
            College of Engineering at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he received a
            PhD in Mechanical Engineering under the guidance of Dr. Paul Oh, former National
            Science Foundation (NSF) Robotics Program Director. His PhD research project was
            to develop a Mobile Manipulating Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MM-UAV) for bridge
            inspection and maintenance with support from the United States Department of
            Transportation (US-DOT) Inspecting and Preserving Through Robotic Exploration
            University Transportation Center (INSPIRE-UTC).

            He is an active volunteer of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS).
            He was the only creator of IROS On-Demand, the innovative conference platform
            that hosted 40,000 international attendees during the pandemic. With this outstanding
            performance, he recently received the Distinguished Service Award from the Robotics
            Society of Japan (RSJ) in 2023.
